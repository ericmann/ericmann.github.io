At Vacasa, AWS accounts represent the unit of isolation for distinct applications & services in our software ecosystem, providing security benefits and operational autonomy for our teams as we scale. Managing accounts at this scale requires strong DevOps practices to maintain security, operational sanity, and uniform observability across the system. In this talk, weâ€™ll cover the benefits of such an approach, the practices that make it possible, and the important role Datadog plays.
