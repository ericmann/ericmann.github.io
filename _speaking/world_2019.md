The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) curates a list of the top ten security risks for web applications and how to mitigate them. The ever-changing world of web development created a challenge for the 2017 list, which needs to combine both existing approaches and modern trends in web development. This session takes a look at each item in the list from a PHP perspective, demonstrates what can go wrong, and makes sure that this wonâ€™t happen in our web sites.
