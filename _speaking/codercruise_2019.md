This session will cover use cases, user groups, and a few proposed techniques for making both content and publishing tools available to those without high-speed Internet, 3G/4G connectivity, or traditional desktop publishing tools. It will also delve into some of the emerging technologies that make content more accessible to those with limited access (and the controversy surrounding them).
